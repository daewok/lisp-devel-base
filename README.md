# Generic Lisp Development Image #

This Docker image is meant to be used for development of Lisp applications in a
uniform environment. The goal is to ahve a single image capable of compiling any
Lisp package in Quicklisp. We're pretty far from that goal and will happily
accept pull requests to add required dependencies for anything in Quicklisp.
