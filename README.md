# Generic Lisp Development Image #

This Docker image is meant to be used for development of Lisp applications in a
uniform environment. The goal of this image is to gather all the major open
source Lisp implementations into one place.

This image contains nothing beyond the Lisp implementations. Another image will
be made shortly that includes quicklisp.
